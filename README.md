## How to run the project
Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. 
### Firstly, run `npm install` from the root.
### After this you will go to the client application `cd front-end`
### Run `npm install` to install all modules again. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run-script dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run-script client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>
